1. tshark cmd generates test.pcap file
2. FilterPackets.py reads test.pcap and generates ./pcapdata/...csv file
3. GenerateFlows.py reads above file and generates ./flowdata/...csv file
4. generatingfortrainingpackets.py creates outputofforalgorithm.csv file, for training move this file to parent folder
5. In parent folder, "svm all kernels" file reads above file and saves model into "linear_svm_model.sav"
6. "Prediction of result" file reads above .sav model and predicts packets captured ("outputofforalgorithm1.csv")
